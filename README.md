## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes information on loan applications and sales data. The key components of the dataset are:

1. **Loan Dataset**: Information about applicants, including their personal details, financial status, and loan application status (approved/rejected).
2. **Sales Dataset**: Data related to the sales performance, such as product sales, revenue, and region-specific sales data.

These datasets can be found in the `data/` folder or downloaded from the specified sources in the project.

## Features

### Loan Prediction Model
- Predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various features such as:
  - Applicant's income
  - Credit score
  - Loan amount requested
  - Employment status
  - Marital status
  - And more...

### Sales Analysis
- Analyze sales data to find trends, patterns, and performance metrics such as:
  - Total sales by region
  - Product-wise sales performance
  - Sales trends over time
  - Predict future sales trends using machine learning models
